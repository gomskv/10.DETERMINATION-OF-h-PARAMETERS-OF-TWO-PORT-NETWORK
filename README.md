**THEORY:**
In ‘h’ parameters of a two port network, voltage of the input port and the current of the output port are expressed in terms of the current of the input port and the voltage of the output port. Due to this reason, these parameters are called as ‘hybrid’ parameters, i.e. out of four variables (i.e. V1, V2, I1, I2) V1, I2 are dependent variables.
Thus,

V1= h11*I1+h12*V2	......(1)
I2 = h2*1I1+h22*V22	....(2)

h11 and h22 are input impedance and output admittance.
h21 and h12 are forward current gain and reverse voltage gain.

 **PROCEDURE:**

a)	Connect the circuit as shown in fig. & switch ‘ON’ the experimentalboard.
b)	Short the output port and excite input port with a known voltage source Vs. So that V1=VsandV2=0. Wedetermine I1andI2toobtain h11andh21.
c)	Input port is open circuited and output port is excited with the same voltage source Vs.SothatV2=VSandI1=0,wedetermine I2andV1toobtainh12andh22.
d)	Switch ‘off’ the supply after taking thereadings.
